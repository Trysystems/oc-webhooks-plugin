This plugin allows you to create shell scripts that respond to unique URLs. These scripts can be particularly useful for deploying your plugins and themes.

With that said, _use your head_. Don't expose your site to massive security problems by allowing malicious code into your scripts.

### GitHub "push to deploy" example

In this example, we'll walk through a basic "push to deploy" example. It is written for GitHub, but the process is roughly the same everywhere. In this example, we'll assume that you've already installed a plugin via GitHub, and have access to the repository settings.

First things first, navigate to `/backend/bedard/webhooks/hooks` and create a new webhook. The script will be pretty simple for this, just cd into your plugin directory and pull.

```bash
cd plugins/bedard/webhooks
git pull
```

Next copy the webhook's URL by clicking on token value in the `URL` column. Now we can head over to our repository on github and instruct it to let us know about push events. To do this, click `Settings, Webhooks & Services, Add webhook`. Fill out the form, and we're done. Our plugin will now update itself whenever code is pushed.
